 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

    push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
    pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
    peek() -- Get the front element.
    empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
    Notes:
    You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
