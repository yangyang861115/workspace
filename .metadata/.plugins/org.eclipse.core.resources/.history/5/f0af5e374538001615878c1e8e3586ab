 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
 * Example: 19 is a happy number
 * 1*1 + 9*9 = 82
 * 8*8 + 2*2 = 68
 * 6*6 + 8*8 = 100
 * 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
